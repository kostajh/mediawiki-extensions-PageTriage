ArticleCreationWorkflow is an extension for MediaWiki. It implements an interface for reviewing
and categorizing new pages. It is designed with the New Pages Patroller in mind, and replaces
Special:NewPages and the patrolled edits feature.

It is very focused on the Wikipedia article creation workflow, though it could probably be adapted
for use on other wikis.

PageTriage is licensed under the same terms as MediaWiki itself.
